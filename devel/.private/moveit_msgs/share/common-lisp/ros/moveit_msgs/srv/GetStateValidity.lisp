It is possible~%# for example to view the disk almost from a side, in which case the visibility cone~%# can end up having close to 0 volume. The view angle is defined to be the angle between~%# the normal to the visibility disc and the direction vector from the sensor origin.~%# The value below represents the minimum desired view angle.
